This is new and in my opinion nice looking Domoticz control Panel.

For now only this things working:
  - automatic download content from domoticz (favourite devices)
  - showing: lightswitches, sockets, temperature sensor, weather sensor (for now only temperature and humidity), covers, motion sensors
  
 In work:
  - drop and down for widgets
  - settings panel
  - clock widget
  - login panel
 
 For now BDCP looks like on this foto
